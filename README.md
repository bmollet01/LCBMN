# Learning Capacity of Bacteria as Machine Learning

## AMN metabolic models :

The proxy of bactria metabolism are AMN model described in the paper of [LÃ©on Faure et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40380-0) in 2023.

Part of the code from the original paper was taken from the repository: https://github.com/brsynth/amn_release licensed under the MIT licence. The corresponding code is: [`src/AMN.py`]()

### Evaluating capacity :

### Method comparison :

### Ablation :

### Substitution :
